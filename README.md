# 🎮 Game Project & ☁️ Cloud Run Experiment

## 🎮 Simple Game
A small game project built as a **learning exercise**.  
It was created to practice coding, test ideas, and have fun while experimenting with development tools.

## ☁️ Cloud Run (Gradio) Demo
As part of my learning journey, I also completed Google’s **Python Hello Cloud Run (Gradio)** codelab.  
This exercise focused on:
- Building a simple **Gradio "Hello World" app**  
- Testing it locally before deployment  
- Deploying the app to **Google Cloud Run**

✨ This repository reflects both my **practice with game development** and my **experiments with deploying apps on Cloud Run**.
